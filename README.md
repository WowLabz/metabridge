Metabridge is a centralized bridge-based application that facilitates the transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) between Substrate based chains and EVM chains. Its part of the [Social.li](https://www.social.li/) ecosystem.

One of the primary advantages of Metabridge is that it allows for the transfer of NFTs between Polygon and Polkadot. This means that users can now move their NFT assets from one blockchain to another with ease. By enabling cross-chain NFT transfers, Metabridge provides users with more flexibility, liquidity, and access to a wider range of services and applications across different blockchain ecosystems.

With respect to metaverses and gaming, the ability to transfer NFTs between different blockchains can be a game-changer. For example, in gaming, players can use NFTs to represent unique in-game assets such as skins, weapons, and characters. With Metabridge, players can transfer these assets from one game to another, or even from one metaverse to another, opening up a world of possibilities for gameplay and creativity.

Additionally, the ability to transfer NFTs between different blockchains can help to increase the liquidity of these assets. For example, a rare NFT that is popular in one blockchain may not have as much demand in another. By transferring this NFT to a different blockchain where it is more in demand, the owner can increase the value of the asset and potentially profit from it.

Another advantage of Metabridge is that it is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to quickly and easily initiate NFT transfers. The app is built on a modern tech stack that leverages the latest tools and technologies to provide users with a smooth and seamless experience.

In summary, while Metabridge is a centralized bridge-based application, it still provides users with a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform to transfer NFTs between Polygon and Polkadot. By enabling cross-chain NFT transfers, Metabridge provides users with more flexibility and access to a wider range of services and applications across different blockchain ecosystems. The ability to transfer NFTs between different blockchains can have a significant impact on metaverses and gaming, increasing liquidity and opening up new possibilities for gameplay and creativity.

# Note: The current project is built strictly for the testnets on both the chains. Hence, access to it is limited.

# Features
1. Two way transfer of Nft's between Substrate based chain & Polygon
2. Compatible with Substrate Chains that use `pallet_uniques` for their Nft Marketplace

# Tech Stack
The app is built on a tech stack that includes Substrate, Solidity, Rust, Nodejs, React, and Typescript. By leveraging the power of these technologies, Metabridge provides users with a fast, secure, and user-friendly platform to transfer NFTs across multiple blockchains.

# Project Compnents
The app consists of several components, each playing a crucial role in enabling cross-chain NFT transfers. In this article, we will provide an overview of each of the components, along with links to the respective GitHub repositories.

## 1. NFT Bridge Frontend
The NFT Bridge Frontend is the user interface for the Metabridge application. It allows users to interact with the smart contracts and initiate NFT transfers between Polygon and Polkadot. The frontend is built using React and TypeScript and is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It provides users with all the necessary information and tools to initiate and track their NFT transfers.

The NFT Bridge Frontend repository can be found on GitHub at: https://github.com/WowLabz/nft_bridge_frontend

## 2. NFT Bridge Backend
The NFT Bridge Backend is the backend component of the Metabridge application. It provides the necessary infrastructure to support the frontend and enables communication with the smart contracts. The backend is built using Node.js and is responsible for handling all user requests and responses. It also provides the necessary security features to ensure that all NFT transfers are secure and transparent.

## 3. NFT Bridge Smart Contracts on Polygon
The NFT Bridge Smart Contracts on Polygon are the heart of the Metabridge application. They are responsible for enabling cross-chain NFT transfers between Polygon and Polkadot. The smart contracts are built using Solidity and are deployed on the Polygon network. They provide a secure and transparent way for users to transfer their NFT assets across different blockchains.

## 4. Substrate Chain Using Pallet Uniques
The Substrate Chain using Pallet Uniques is another component of the Metabridge project. It provides the necessary infrastructure to support the transfer of NFTs between Polygon and Polkadot. The Substrate Chain is built using Rust and leverages the Pallet Uniques library to manage NFT assets. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage NFT assets and enables interoperability between different blockchain ecosystems.

# Future Plans
1. Support for more blockchains - The Metabridge project aims to expand its services by integrating support for more blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance, Solana, Dfinity, etc. This will enable users to transfer their NFT assets across multiple blockchain ecosystems, further promoting interoperability in the blockchain space.

2. Decentralized architecture - In Phase 2 of the project, the Metabridge team plans to decentralize the platform by introducing a peer-to-peer architecture that enables direct communication between users, removing the need for a central authority. This will increase transparency and security and further promote the trustless nature of blockchain technology.

3. Integration with other metaverses and web3 games - The Metabridge team plans to integrate the NFT bridge with other metaverses and web3 games, such as Decenterland, Sandbox, Metahome, which are part of the Socialli protocol. This will enable users to transfer their NFT assets between different virtual worlds and games, unlocking new possibilities for digital asset ownership and management.

4. Support for VR/AR - The Metabridge team plans to add support for VR/AR experiences such as Horizon Worlds and other metaverses. This will enable users to experience their NFT assets in fully immersive virtual environments, further enhancing the value and utility of their digital assets.

5. Improved user experience - The Metabridge team plans to continually improve the user experience of the NFT bridge by introducing new features and tools that make it easier for users to manage their NFT assets. This includes the introduction of a mobile application and the integration of more intuitive user interfaces and dashboards.

6. Integration with other blockchain services - The Metabridge team plans to integrate the NFT bridge with other blockchain services, such as decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, to enable users to use their NFT assets for various blockchain activities. This will further increase the utility of NFT assets and unlock new revenue streams for users.

Overall, the Metabridge project is continuously evolving, and the team has ambitious plans to expand the services of the platform and improve the user experience. With support for more blockchains, integration with other metaverses and web3 games, support for VR/AR experiences, and a decentralized architecture, the project aims to provide users with the tools and infrastructure needed to fully leverage the potential of NFT assets in the blockchain space.
